# Java Practice Programs

This repo contains all my Java practice programs, organized by topic:

- basics (HelloWorld, Variables, Loops)
- oops (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- collections (List, Set, Map)
- exceptions (try-catch, custom exceptions)

I am maintaining this repo as a reference while learning Java ðŸš€
